## Local Setup

###Node
In order to set up this development version of the app you need <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">nodejs</a> installed at your system.
After setting up node you have to install the dependencies, run
```
npm install
```
in a console within the main directory and all dependencies declared in package.json will be installed.


###MongoDB

You need MongoDB running at your system. Head over to <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">mongodb.org</a> to get started.

With this set up just type
```

and the node server will be listening on localhost:3000

###Jasmine and Karma

```
npm start
```

##HEROKU DEPLOYMENT
The App itself has been deployed to heroku.com and can be reached <a href="https://wg-manager.herokuapp.com" target="_bank">here<a/>.
